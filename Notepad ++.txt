Consider an example that all the lines start with a prefix file_ (like file_my1.txt, file_my2.txt etc), the click ‘Cntrl+H’ and search for file_ and replace with new_prefix. This will result in a leading space character in all the lines, follow this section to remove that.

Prefix/Suffix not Present

Enter the prefix you want to add,say new_prefix, in the first row/column. Click ‘Cntrl’ and drag the small black rectangular box to the number of lines you want to add the prefix to (i.e if there are 10 lines drag till the 10th row). Copy the text from the text file and paste it in the second column. Now copy first and second rows and paste it back in the notepad++. If you find and space between the prefix and the previous text then follow this section to remove that.
